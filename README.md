NightwatchJS demo repository

I have more than 7 years of experience with NightwatchJS and this demo repo will contain demo tests, code snippets, and other functions that I found helpful.

I will eventually update this one to handle more robust CLI arguments, but for now, a simple `npx nightwatch -t tests/homePageDemo.js` will run the Home Page Demo test in Chrome.
